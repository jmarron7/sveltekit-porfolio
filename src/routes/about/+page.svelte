<h2 class="text-3xl mb-2 font-semibold">About Me</h2>

<p>
	I'm a fullstack software engineer based in Memphis, TN. I enjoy listening to live music, being out
	in nature, eating great food, spending time with loved ones, and creating solutions with code.

<br />

<p>
	My programming journey started back in middle school when some of my online friends at the time
	were working on an online text-based RPG. I was curious about their project and was exposed to
	HTML, CSS, PHP, and MySQL for the first time. At the time, PHP and MySQL didn't make much sense to
	me and I found the visual feedback of the frontend more appealing.
</p>

<br />

<p>
	Once I was in high school, I was still creating simple sites with HTML and CSS and using Lua a lot
	more to create scripts for games I was playing at the time. I also spent a lot of time learning <a

		target="_blank"
		class="underline decoration-2 text-secondary-500 hover:text-secondary-700">TI-BASIC</a
	>
	to create programs on the TI-83 calculator to help me solve various math equations and formulas a lot
	faster.
</p>

<br />

<p>
	I later enrolled into the University of Memphis' Computer Science program where I learned about
	Java and got about halfway through the program before putting it on pause. I still very much knew
	that I wanted to pursue a career in tech so I continued learning about software development. I
	ended up taking a few courses with
	<a
		href="https://www.tech901.org/"
		target="_blank"
		class="underline decoration-2 text-primary-500 hover:text-primary-700"
	>
		Tech901
	</a> where I gained skills in IT fundamentals, computer science fundamentals, and data analytics.
</p>

<br />

<p>
	I landed a contract role working as an IT Service Desk Analyst while still enrolled in one fo the
	Tech901 courses. I was continued to learn about software development and started to pick up more
	technologies and languages like Python, Django, React, and Typescript. I also started volunteering
	with <a
		href="https://www.code-crew.org/"
		target="_blank"
		class="underline decoration-2 text-error-500 hover:text-error-700">CodeCrew</a
	> as a Technical Volunteer during their "Hour of Code" event and still try to volunteer once a year
	for the same event. With my IT troubleshooting skills and coding knowledge, I was able to transition
	into a Systems Engineering role once my previous contract role ended. There I learned a lot about both
	Windows and Linux systems, cloud environments, and even was able to create various scripts in Python,
	Powershell, and Bash to automate some of the more tedious configurations and tasks that we had to perform
	regularly.
</p>

<br />

<p>
	By this point, I have been able to gather various skills that included troubleshooting end-user
	issues, spinning up Linux servers in a virtualized environment, and creating automated scripts to
	increase workflow efficiency. This combination of skills allowed me to transition into a Software
	Engineering role on a Windows Platform Team where my main focus was on infrastructure automation.
	During my time there, I worked on creating a service to automate the process in which servers were
	commissioned, provisioned, and decommissioned via the use of Azure Automation Runbooks where I
	used Python and Powershell scripts along with infrastructure-as-code tools such as Hashicorp
	Packer and VMware APIs. Additionally, I setup Azure Repos for the team to use and provided
	trainings to the team to explain the benefits of source control and to explain the software
	development lifecycle.
</p>

<br />

<p>
	My time there was cut short but used this opportunity to further my learning with the aim of
	becoming a fully-fledge software engineer. I decided to learn Go and Svelte and was immediately
	hooked by both! After a few months of doing some self study, I decided it was time to change my
	approach and enrolled in
	<a
		href="https://www.allaboutfasttrack.com/"
		target="_blank"
		class="underline decoration-2 text-warning-500 hover:text-warning-700"
		>Cook Systems' FastTrack Fullstack Software Development Program.
	</a> I recently graduated from the program and learned how to use Java, Spring Boot, Angular, Typescript,
	and PostgreSQL to build fullstack applications both from scratch and under predefined requirements.
</p>

	Currently, I'm open to work on freelance projects and also open to talking about potential
	Software Engineer opportunities. If you are interested in reaching out, feel free to contact me
