	<h2 class="text-2xl mb-2 font-semibold">Hi, I'm Jesus üëã</h2>

	<p>
		I'm a fullstack software engineer based in Memphis, TN. I enjoy listening to live music, being
		out in nature, eating great food, spending time with loved ones, and creating solutions with
		code. üßë‚Äçüíª
	</p>

	<br />

	<p>
		My programming journey started back in middle school when some of my online friends at the time
		were working on an online text-based RPG. I was curious about their project and was exposed to
		HTML, CSS, PHP, and MySQL for the first time. At the time, PHP and MySQL didn't make much sense
		to me and I found the visual feedback of the frontend more appealing.
	</p>

	<br />

	<p>
		Once I was in high school, I was still creating simple sites with HTML and CSS and using Lua a
		lot more to create scripts for games I was playing at the time. I also spent a lot of time
		learning <a
			href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TI-BASIC_83"
			target="_blank"
			class="underline text-secondary-500 hover:text-secondary-700">TI-BASIC</a
		>
		to create programs on the TI-83 calculator to help me solve various math equations and formulas a
		lot faster.
	</p>

	<br />

	<p>
		I later enrolled into the University of Memphis' Computer Science program and got about halfway
		through the program before putting it on pause. I still very much knew that I wanted to pursue a
		career in tech so I continued learning about software development. I ended up taking a few
		courses with
		<a
			href="https://www.tech901.org/"
			target="_blank"
			class="underline text-primary-500 hover:text-primary-700"
		>
			Tech901
		</a> where I gained skills in IT fundamentals, computer science fundamentals, and data analytics.
	</p>

	<br />

	<p>
		I was able to land a contract role working as an IT Service Desk Analyst while still enrolled in
		a Tech901 course. I was still able to find time outside of work to learn more about software
		development and started to pick up more technologies and languages like Python, React, and
		Typescript. With my IT troubleshooting skills and coding knowledge, I was able to transition
		into a Systems Engineering role once my previous contract role ended. There I learned a lot
		about both Windows and Linux systems and even was able to create various scripts in Python,
		Powershell, and Bash to automate some of the more tedious configurations and tasks that we had
		to perform regularly.
